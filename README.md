# Image-Classification-using-Cifar-100-dataset
Python code for testing robustness of various machine learning algorithms against dataset broken down as milestones.


#Milestone 1: 
Goal is to perform a binary classification of images in vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 superclass pairs with several traditional machine learning algorithms and CNN.

#Milestone 2: 
The main goal of this project milestone is to design algorithms that would be able to predict a sub-class not available during the training stage. 1 subclass hidden from each of the two super classes.

#Milestone 3 (Final Report): 
The main goal of this project is to perform binary classification of images in vehicle 1 and vehicle 2. The robustness of the algorithm is tested against hiding 2 sub-classes image data during the training stage.
